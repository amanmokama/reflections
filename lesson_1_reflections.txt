Should not be doing an octopus
 
Octopus is a strategy Git uses to combine many different versions of code together. 
This message can appear if you try to use this strategy in an inappropriate situation.



You are in 'detached HEAD' state 

HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. 
You can “detach” the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, 
which we’ll see in the next video. Despite what it sounds like, 
it’s actually not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. 
Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.
